<h1>built an entire working React based, voice chat news app, that you can give commands to, and it will read out all the news for you! How cool is that! Your own friendly neighbourhood news reader is here :) </h1>

<h3># TechStack :

# React : Obviously, organzing the entire frontend themes, using the useState, useEffect , and useStyles hooks (material UI) with component based architecture has been heavily exploited in this project!

# MaterialUI : Used this to perform the basic card based styling of all the cards, used material grid to make the site much more responsive, and finally to add the active animation class as the news is being read!

# AlanAIStudio : Made some async API calls to the "newsapi.org" API's for the getting ,handling, and passing the news objects to be finally rendered by the React App!

To open a link from a particular article list, say "Open number 3" || "Open 3";

Ask this app : 'Who is your master?' and 'What is your purpose?', you won't be disappointed ;) </h3>
